# Flask SocketIO Chat Application

## Project Overview
This project is a simple chat application built using Flask and Flask-SocketIO. It allows users to send messages in real-time via WebSockets. This application serves as an example of how to use Flask with SocketIO to handle bi-directional communication between the server and the clients.

## Installation
To run the Flask SocketIO Chat Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-socketio-chat.git
   cd flask-socketio-chat
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask Flask-SocketIO
   ```

## Usage
To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start up and listen on port 5050. You can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5050` to view the chat application.

Once the application is open in a browser, you can open multiple windows or tabs to start chatting in real-time. Messages sent in one window will be broadcast to all connected clients.

## Features
- Real-time messaging between clients using WebSockets.
- Simple interface to send and receive messages.
- Broadcast messages to all connected clients.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages as specified in `requirements.txt`:
- Flask
- Flask-SocketIO

To install these dependencies without manually installing, create a `requirements.txt` file and include the following:
```
Flask==2.2.2
Flask-SocketIO==5.3.2
```

Then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
The project directory has the following structure:
```
flask-socketio-chat/
├── app.py                # Main application file where the Flask app is defined
└── templates/
    └── index.html       # HTML template for the chat interface
```

- `app.py`: Contains the Flask app setup, SocketIO initialization, and message handling functionality.
- `templates/index.html`: The HTML file that renders the chat interface.

## Acknowledgments
This project is made possible through Flask and SocketIO, which simplifies real-time communication in web applications.

Feel free to modify and enhance this simple chat application as per your requirements!
